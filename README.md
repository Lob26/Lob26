  - ⚡ Fun facts
    - The etymology of 'melancholy' follows the ancient belief that the feeling was a consequence of an excess of black bile
    - So... 'Blue' is a (kind of) newer word than 'bronze'. That's why in ancient Greek writings, the sea was referred to as 'dark-wine' and the sky was referred to as 'bronze'
